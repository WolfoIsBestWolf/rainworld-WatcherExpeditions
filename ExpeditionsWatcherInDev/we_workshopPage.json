This is a mod that adds Watcher as a selectable character in Expedition mode.
Adds all the Watcher creatures and Watcher to Sandbox/Arena because sure why not.
Adds all the Watcher ost to the Jukebox

[b][h1]Expeditions:
[/h1][/b]Start in random Watcher region. (non story, non rot region)
Start with 6 Ripple, 9 max ripple and 5 minimum ripple.
Expedition will end if you die at your lowest Ripple.
Spinning Top will not increase max & min Ripple.

Karma Flowers will still spawn despite Expedition normally removing them.
Normally in all regions, but if that is disabled only in Outer Rim, Daemon & Shattered Terrace

The Rot will have bloomed, but he has no purpose.
Game wont force you into Outer Rim. (50% chance to replace bad warps is always there)
The expedition will end prematurely if you enter the Bedroom in Ancient Urban.
Ancient Urban can be entered without needing 9 Ripple.


[b][h1]Challenges:
[/h1][/b]Most Watcher enemies can show up as Hunt challenges.
Shattered Terrace and Rot Regions are exluded.

Vista points have been added to some watcher regions, not all.

Find Spinning Top in one of the 13 Regions they spawn in. 
The Echo Challenge replacement.

New Challenge : Infect 3-9 regions with Rot. 5 at default difficulty. 
Kind of a Neuron Delivery replacement.  

(Would do Prince Delivery, but he has no unique dialogue, nor are there new colored pearls yet)


[b][h1]Content:
[/h1][/b]A Perk where you gain Watchers Camo
A Perk where you start with a Poison Spear.
A Watcher Exclusive Perk where created Warps stay open forever, instead of closing after 5 cycles.

A burden where every region starts at 100% rot and a Mission associated with it.


[b][h1]Other
[/h1][/b]
Obviously ending scripts are disabled.
OuterRim_Desert6 will always have a exit portal, not just when at too early in progression.

Passaging will work if you use that unlock. It will use the normal area screen because the Warp Sphere is incompatible with Passages. 
Areas will be blank screens as there is no art for them, use top right to just select the area you want.
There is also a config to allow this in Watcher Campaign.

Fixes Custom Colors not working, Remix and Jolly.

Watcher Expedition Co-op seems to work. Portals may throw you a unusual amount.
Using multiple Watchers in Co-op is fine for the most part. Ripple Space may be confusing and only 1 Watcher seems to get the cosmetic ripple trail.
Using Watcher outside of a Watcher Expedition will allow him to Camo and Hover as if he had 5 Ripple.
Obviously he cannot make Portals outside of his Expeditions.

Only player 1 Watcher will leave mini ripples.


I do not know if official support is coming, there is some reference to Watcher in Expedition code but not anything too meaningful.


[b][h1]Vista Locations:
[/h1][/b]If you do not like blindly exploring to find Vistas, you could use Expedition Extra Config for a vista map.
Alternatively here are the room codes I chose.

[b][h1]Known Issues:
[/h1][/b]Camo Perk might be a bit jank looking on some character. (Gourmand is weirdly square if you have it on)
If disabling mod, and your "Expedition last selected character" is Watcher. The game tries to default to Monk. Sometimes this can fail, then, select a different a character first.
